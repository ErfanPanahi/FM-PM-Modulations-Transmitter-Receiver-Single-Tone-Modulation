# FM-PM-Modulations-Transmitter-Receiver-Single-Tone-Modulation-
In this repository, we focus on the implementation of transmitter and receiver systems for angle modulations, including FM and PM, and compare narrowband phase modulation (NBPM) and narrowband frequency modulation (NBFM) modulations.

*The purpose of conducting this project is to investigate angle modulation, including Phase Modulation (PM) and Frequency Modulation (FM). In the first section, we become acquainted with frequency and phase modulators, followed by their narrowband modulator counterparts. In the second section, we familiarize ourselves with frequency and phase demodulators, and we examine the recovered signals using the derivative and envelope detector blocks. Finally, in the third section, we also become familiar with single-sideband modulation and investigate the power series approximation.* (CA3_Matlab_810198369.mlx)
